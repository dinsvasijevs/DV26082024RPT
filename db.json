This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.\n\nWhat is JavaScript?\nJavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.\n\nJavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!\n\nJavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:\n\nBrowser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.\nThird-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Disqus or Facebook.\nThird-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.",
